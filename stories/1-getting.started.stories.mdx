### Accessibility 


The Web Accessibility means the possibility for people experiencing discomfort due to a permanent disability (sensory, motor or cognitive disability, aging...), temporary (accident, pregnancy...) or external circumstances, to access online services and content without needing the assistance of a third party. When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. We are committed to creating a design system with fully accessible graphic elements.
